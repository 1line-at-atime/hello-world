# hello-world
Getting started with Github. This project is based around learning about repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. 

Greetings, Earthlings!

I'm no stranger to Github, but having my own account and starting to use it for my own projects is uber-exciting! As my username states, I'm planning to master this one line at a time. I'm crazy about Ruby, Python and Tilly (she's my Siamese/Manx mix cat). I dare you to say "Manx mix" ten times!
